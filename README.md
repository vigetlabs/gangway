# Endpoint

An api abstraction layer.

TODO:

Now, really go into detail here. What does this project do? Why does
it exist? What goals does this project aspire to achieve?

**Badges, Travis? CircleCI? Place them here**

## Overview

Introduce the code you are about to display

```
Give a quick example of the code. A taste of working with the API
```

Now go into further detail. But not too much implementation, there is
a learning section.

## Learning

Are there tutorials? Use this section to guide the reader to where there
hand can be held

## Documentation

Where does documentation exist? Is there anything important about it
the reader should know?

## Final words

Add a final section that might include any important prior art or
inspiration. If this isn't your thing, maybe a link to Viget Open
Source.
